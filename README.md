# Solar-Power-Generation-Prediction

This repository contains data analysis for predicting and forecasting solar power generation in a solar plant using machine learning techniques. The goal is to leverage weather data and historical power generation to create models that can help in better grid management and stability.

Overview

Files Included:

Plant_2_Generation_Data.csv: Contains data related to power generation in the solar plant, including DC Power, AC Power, Daily Yield, Total Yield, and Date-Time information.

Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv: Includes weather-related data like Ambient Temperature, Module Temperature, Irradiation, and Date-Time information.

Analysis and Insights:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distributions, correlations, and trends within the data.

Feature Engineering: Derive new features or preprocess existing ones for better model performance.

Model Development: Utilize machine learning models to predict/future forecast solar power generation based on weather patterns and historical data.

Solar Radiation Terminology:

Peak Sun Hours (PSH): Daily irradiation providing energy equivalent to 1kW/m2 for a certain number of hours.

Irradiation/Insolation: Total radiant solar energy received per unit area over a specific period.

Irradiance: Solar radiation incident on a surface at a particular time, measured in W/m2.

Challenges and Goals:

Prediction: Develop models to predict solar power generation accurately based on weather conditions.

Grid Management: Use forecasts for better grid stability and management, optimizing power distribution.
